SPACETOASTER is a simple space shooter where you play as a toaster. Sail through an endless starscape and show the advancing shapes what you've got! (Toast)

SPACETOASTER is written purely in JavaScript, with some animations done using CSS. Currently, the code loops through one simple scripted level. More exciting graphical effects, sound, performance improvements (and performance scaling), and more distinct game conditions are coming later.

Barring any website issues, you can play it here! (Live version may or may not be up to date with the repo) https://chrisisgre.at/spacetoaster/SpaceToaster.html
